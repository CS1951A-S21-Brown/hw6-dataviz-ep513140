            <p style="font-size 14px;">1. I was working with the football dataset. The first question was to find the number of football games by year with a minimum of 5 years. I used a scatter plot for this in order to show correlation over time of football games versus year. In order to do this, I created a hash set with the key being the year and the value being the number of games with that year by looping through the rows in the dataset and incrementing the value for each year’s key. For the second question, I was finding the winning percentage for each team and then plotting the top ten nations based on winning percentage. I similarly used a hashset but this time just to keep track of if a team was in a dictionary or not, if they were not I pushed to the dictionary the teams name, number of games played, numbers games won, and winning percentage. If the team was already in the dataset, I incremented games played and depending on the scores, I would increment games won. After looping through all of the games, I calculated the winning percentage for each team which was #win/#games played. I then found the top 10 highest percentages and plotted them in order. I chose to use a bar graph for this question because we aren’t as interested in the correlation between the winning percentages, which we were interested in when looking at the games per year graph. Finally, the third question asked who we should bet on winning the FIFA World Cup in 2022 based on the last two World Cups data. I chose to once again compare the winning percentages of each team but only for games played in the last two FIFA world cups. I calculated the winning percentages the same as the previous question, but I just filtered to make sure the year and tournament were FIFA and 2014 or 2018. I chose to implement buttons that allow the user to see what the data would look like if we only used the 2014 FIFA data or the 2018 FIFA data, as well as both years’ data. I used a lollipop graph which is similar to a bar graph because we aren’t as interested in the correlation between teams. Also, I chose to leave out the winning percentage labels and the user can hover over them with their mouse to view the winning percentage, as instructed in text underneath the graph.</p>
            <p style="font-size 14 px;">2. D3 was awesome for doing this assignment. It was really helpful by having easy-to-learn resources online to learn how to use different components such as different graphs like a lollipop or how to update data using a button. I think it is also really helpful it’s use of buttons which are created in the html and calls a ruction in your javascript and can be edited for style using CSS so it is cool that components like a button or graph can go between HTML, CSS, and javascript. Lastly, I think D3 was very helpful in taking the tedium out of creating visualizations. For example, with matplotlib, a lot of times you have to tinker with small values to edit text placement or graph placement, but D3 has built in functions such as “anchoring” which takes values “start”, “middle”, and “end” to decide where in the text D3 should place the text at a position. One more reason, just for fun, it also creates really modern-looking graphs I think as opposed to matplotlib, it has more of a focus on design and sleekness than academic-looking matplotlib graphs which can be boring and not very gripping.</p>
            <p style="font-size 14 px;">3. I think one of the issues with D3 is that it requires the user to learn JavaScript which is not typically what users, especially working in data science who often need to create visualizations, learn immediately and usually they know Python which is very different from JavaScript conceptually and syntactically in my opinion. I also think that D3 is really powerful and gives the coder the ability to make really complicated, cool-looking visualizations, but this is not always the best for displaying data and getting the point across. Sometimes, if there are too many features, the graph can be inaccessible to people, especially people who aren’t as tech-savvy and don’t know what hovering with a mouse means so they wouldn’t be able to see mouse-hover data that is otherwise hidden. I think D3 can be tempting to make complicated visualizations but may not always be the most successful way to portray data. Lastly, D3 can be inaccessible to learners because it requires a knowledge of HTML in order to create buttons and graphs etc which is yet another language the user needs to learn which would not normally be taught in a data science class.</p>
            <p style="font-size 14 px;">4. I think that my graphs are pretty accessible. I chose to use only one color across the whole graph, green, so that the color blind would not have to try to parse the data based on the color of the bars. For my bar graph, I used a gradient with the bars to signal there is a change between the bars from lower winning percentages to higher percentages which helps color blind people looking at the data. I also used padding in my bar graph as instructed by the “Guide to Accessible Data Visualization” in order to help the visually impaired people to view the bar graph. People who are completely blind would have a hard time using as assistive program to look at my lollipop graph because I did not include the winning percentage values in the graph, I only display it when using mouse hover which is inaccessible to these programs. I did include axis labels and graph titles which is helpful for everyone to understand the data. I think I would take additional action in the future by finding a way to include mouse hover data, as instructed by the assignment, and also including the winning percentage values without redundancy. I didn’t want to include the winning percentages for the lollipop and hover data because I thought it would be redundant.</p>
            <p style="font-size 14 px;">5. I think I could have made the graphs bigger and the axis titles and team names larger which would be more accessible to the visually impaired who have a hard time reading small font. I also think that the lollipop graph might not be the most easy graph to read for the visually impaired because of the the thin line connecting the dots. I think I was prevented from doing this because I didn’t want the graphs to be so huge they were overwhelming and I didn’t want to make the lines on the lollipop graph larger because I thought it would look chunky and unappealing. Lastly, as stated in the previous paragraph, I could have included the winning percentages in the lollipop graph other than in the hover data, but I wanted to avoid redundancy. </p>
